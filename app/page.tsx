It would be appropriate to mention here that as both the sons of the deceased being major were not found to be dependants upon their deceased father, therefore, learned Tribunal applied deduction @ 50% from the annual income of the deceased. Apart from that, Rs.10000/- was awarded towards funeral, transportation and consortium, therefore, the claimants were held to be entitled for a total compensation of Rs.2,26,000/- along with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of institution of the petition till its realization.

Pranay Sethi and others, 2017 (4) RCR (Civil) 1009 has not been awarded and even the multiplier of 11 needs to be applied.
